PrecisionGamingOptimizer is a **Windows gaming optimization toolkit** designed to extract the **maximum possible FPS and lowest latency** from gaming PCs.

Version **v2.0.0 (ULTIMATE FPS MODE)** introduces an **aggressive, performance-first profile** intended for **competitive gaming**, prioritizing raw performance and responsiveness over power saving and background comfort.

⚠️ This mode is recommended primarily for **desktop PCs**.  
Laptop users should proceed with caution.
